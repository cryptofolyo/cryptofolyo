### One week after publishing his whitepaper Satoshi says this.

Let us analyse the **thought process of Satoshi nakamoto** one week after posting the bitcoin whitepaper

Is it possible to figure out how Satoshi would have made bitcoin if he made it in 2023 in todays world, using the latest technologies available today reading through his own original thoughts share in his ning posts?

What happens if that solution which was previously impossible in 2009 is possible now due to advances in technology?

On february 11th 2009 Satoshi posted [bitcoin whitepaper](https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source)  on the P2P foundation on ning

**1 week later** Sepp Hasslberger on February 18, 2009  had posted the [following question](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9559) to Satoshi Nakomoto to which the above reply was made.

## Sepps Question

>I have two questions, Satoshi.
>
>the first one ties in with Joerg's doubts about the trusted supply of tokens/coins.
>
>As far as I understand, there will be a `limit of the total amount of tokens` that can be created, and a changing `gradient of difficulty in making` the tokens, where the elaboration gets more and more difficult with time. Is that correct?
>
>It is important that there be a limit in the amount of tokens/coins. But `it is also important that this limit be adjustable to take account of how many people adopt the system`. If the number of users changes with time, it will also be `necessary to change the total amount of coins`.
>
>Is there a formula to decide on what should be the total amount of tokens, and if so, what is the formula?
>
>If there is no formula, who gets to make that decision and based on what criteria will it be made?
>
>I will keep my second question for later. One thing at a time...

On the same day Feb 18th of 2009 Satoshi Nakomoto [answered](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9562) as follows.

## Satoshis Answer
>It is a global distributed database, with additions to the database by consent of the majority, based on a set of rules they follow:
>
>- Whenever someone finds proof-of-work to generate a block, they get some new coins
>- The proof-of-work difficulty is adjusted every two weeks to target an average of 6 blocks per hour (for the whole network)
>- The coins given per block is cut in half every 4 years
>
>You could say coins are issued by the majority. They are issued in a limited, predetermined amount.
>
>As an example, if there are 1000 nodes, and 6 get coins each hour, it would likely take a week before you get anything.

>To Sepp's question, indeed there is `nobody to act as central bank` or federal reserve `to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows.` That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some `clever way`, or if we wanted to trust someone to `actively manage the money supply` to `peg it to something`, the ***`rules could have been programmed for that.`***
>
>In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.


The clever way to determine the value of real world things came into being with `Chainlink`. [Ampleforth](https://www.ampleforth.org/) team precisely utilised this opportunity to act as a central bank to 'adjust the money supply' against a 'fixed peg' as mentioned in **Satoshis Answer** as the population of users grows. Ampleforth built it in a way that was previously not possible at the time when satoshi proposed bitcoin. Though i am not very sure the idea of ampleforth is inspired from these original posts by satoshi.

>In case of AMPL Instead of the value changing to keep the supply the same, the value is predetermined and the supply changes


So in case of AMPL if the demand keeps increasing the market value will go higher than the predetermined value of 2019 CPI adjusted value for 1 USD,( 1.14 USD as on the day of writing this article) then the total supply is increased ( rebasing ) and the increase in total supply is equitably distributed amongst all the AMPL holders proportionate to their previous holdings. Unlike the Fed or central banks the increase in money the supply dilutes the valuation of all existing holders. And leads to [**`Cantillon effect'**](https://austriancenter.com/cantillon-effect-populism/) where corporations, banks etc more closer to money are most benefited  This means as the demand increases the total quantity of ampl in your wallet keeps increasing along with price going above the peg to say like 1.5 or 1.7 USD. The positive rebasing keeps increasing the quantity of AMPL in the wallet to go higher as long as the price remains above the Peg Value. As the demand for AMPL decreases the total quantity of AMPL in your wallet decreases proportionately.


>For example if someone buys and hold AMPL for an investment of 1,000 USD in AMPL made when AMPL market cap is at 100 million will be valued at 100,00 USD if the market cap touch 1 billion. ( Because the 1000 AMPL bought at 1 USD would have rebased to 10000 AMPL by the time the market cap is at 1 billion )

> Is AMPL at 50 million USD market cap is AMPL an opportunity like in the early days of bitcoin?
In order to commit a long term farming contract etc paid in half now and half after 6 months on harvest the payment in bitcoin or satoshi may not be widely accepted because of the volatile nature
Does AMPL Spot - a derivative of AMPL which is pegged to USD value of 2019 - and inflation resistant stable coin become the currency of choice for such trade contracts?
Will AMPL volume become comparable to that of USDT in future?
Only time can answer these questions.
