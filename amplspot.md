# Title: Introducing the AMPL-SPOT Pool: A Unique Blend of Stability and Growth

## Introduction:

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency investments, a new opportunity has emerged that combines stability and growth potential. The AMPL-SPOT Pool offers investors the chance to participate in a pool where SPOT tokens can be parked, half converted into AMPL tokens, and locked for a specific period. This innovative investment option aims to provide diversification, profit-sharing, and long-term stability. Let's explore the key features and benefits of the AMPL-SPOT Pool.

### The target user of the pool is a defi stable coin investor aiming higher returns per annum at higher risk.

The user can Lock SPOT into the pool
The user can earn dividend as SPOT from the Pool
The user can Unlock the same quantity of SPOT from the pool after a minimum lock in of 1 month ( Only if Pool is positive )

## Objectives of the Pool

- To become the bedrock of SPOT Demand in DEFI. Half of the SPOT converted to AMPL leading to increased AMPL demand as well.
- Increase the buying into SPOT during negative rebasing by means of incentivising investors buying into dip and doing dollar cost averaging on AMPL ecosystem.
- This will become like a clock winding its springs. The more negative it goes the more incentive to join pool. The more duration it stays negative the more buying can happen in discounts. So this might eventually make AMPL negative rebase potential very small. 
- Locking the AMPL expansion profits systematically every week and thereby establishing a yearly yield on SPOT
- Provide a track record in the form of a chart of dividend percentage every week on SPOT tokens utilising the potential of AMPL positive rebase. 

### A Balanced Investment Approach:

The AMPL-SPOT Pool allows investors to park their SPOT tokens into the pool, providing them with exposure to both AMPL and SPOT. By diversifying their holdings, investors can potentially mitigate risk and capitalize on growth opportunities.

### Weekly Conversion and Lock-in Period:

Every week, half of the newly parked SPOT tokens are automatically converted into AMPL tokens. This conversion ensures a balanced allocation within the pool, creating a well-rounded investment portfolio. Additionally, the parked SPOT tokens are locked in the pool for a specific period of 1 month upto 5 years. This lock-in period encourages long-term investment strategies, providing stability and reducing the impact of short-term market fluctuations.

### Profit-Sharing and Dividends:

The AMPL-SPOT Pool offers a unique profit-sharing mechanism. Each week, the cumulative value of the pool is calculated, taking into account the performance of the AMPL tokens. If the value of AMPL experiences a positive rebasing, half of the profit is converted back into SPOT tokens. These converted SPOT tokens are then issued as dividends to the pool holders proportionate to their holdings. This innovative approach allows investors to participate in the pool's success and enjoy regular returns on their investment.

### Pool Loading incentive during Negative Pool value:

Investors joining the pool during a negative rebasing period gain a distinct advantage. They have the opportunity to acquire a higher percentage of the pool for a lower investment amount. The early investors may be in a disadvantage in this scenario. But if incentives are provided to investors supporting the pool in deep negative pool state then the pool investments will be averaged. even earlier investors can add more SPOT and increase their percentage and claim the incentives as well. It will work like dollar cost averaging. The deeper the pool goes negative the higher has to be the incentive to join the pool. 

Already as the pool value is lower the investor gain a higher percentage of the pool with lower SPOT investment. In addition to this 

If the total pool SPOT value is trading at 90% of the total invested SPOT value  then pool is trading at 10% loss. It means the investor will get additional 10% increase in his dividend share.
If pool is trading at 20% loss then the new coming investor will get an additional 20% on his dividend claim. This means if the pool invested value is 100000 SPOT and trading at 80000 SPOT value and then investor adds 20000 SPOT to the pool. Then his claim is on 20000 SPOT added to 80000 SPOT value that is 25% dividend is his claim. Incentive is additional 20% on the 25% as the pool is trading in 20% loss. ( That means he gets 30% dividend rights) All the older investors Pool share are decreased accordingly. Older investors will be incentivised to do dollar cost averaging by adding more percentage at lower value 

This feature enables investors to maximize their holdings and capitalize on market downturns, turning unfavorable conditions into potential opportunities for growth.

### Loading Premium for new investors during positive pool value. 
Similarly Investors joining the pool during positive rebasing period and the pool value in profits compared to the total invested value then those new investors joining will be having an advantage of procuring the pool at a safer time to invest. So in order to compensate the risk for the early joiners , the late joiners during positive pool value will have to pay a premium. Their dividend will be reduced proportionately to the existing profit of the pool.

So if they deserve a dividend share of 10% and they join when the pool is in 5% profits. then they get a reduction of 5% in their dividend, so 10% - 5% of 10% = 9.5% will be their dividend. 
If the pool is in 20% profit then if they deserve 10% dividend then they will be paid only 8% after reducing the 20% of the 10% profit of pool. Detailed example is given as the last part of this document. The 2% loading premium will thus benefit all the pre existing investors.

During redemption the same amount in SPOT is redeemed irrespective of the joining during positive pool value or negative pool value. 

### Time lock incentives - Higher dividend incentive for Locking for more time span as following.
Similar incentive on dividend can be given for those investors locking for more time span as following
minimum locking period 1 month - no incentive
2 months get 2% incentive
3 months get 3% incentive
and so on and so forth. Maximum 60 months to earn additional 60% incentive, the higher the time lock the more the risk taken by investor and the more the stability of the pool so higher the incentive.

### invitation protocol 
To incentivise invitation into the pool anyone joining the pool with an invite link will get an additional 10% in terms of dividend That is if they deserve to get 10% dividend they will get 11% 
If John joins the pool with the invitation of Alice then alice gets 5% of all the dividends going to John That means out of the 11% Alice get 5% of that 11% meaning 0.55% during each dividend transfer to John. 
The more number of people Alice educate and make awareness and invite into the protocol the more free dividends Alice can earn. Alice need not be an investing member of the pool to invite another member into the pool. This means that Alice can start earning dividends with zero investment. 

### Flexibility and Liquidity:

The AMPL-SPOT Pool also offers flexibility to investors. Those who wish to unlock their investment can do so after their lock in periods if the pool is in a profitable state. This feature provides liquidity and control over investments, allowing investors to adjust their holdings based on their financial goals and market conditions. If the pool is in negative the dividends are not issued and the investments cannot be unlocked and the investor has to wait for positive rebasing. It ensures that investors all will not empty the pool in a negative state. All will have to wait. 

### Developer Team Incentives:
During each dividend issue 2% of the total dividend issued is issued to the developer account.
This will be divided across the developer team members based on the weightage for each member of the team. 


### Example Scenarios
-> Alice buy 10000 SPOT 
-> Alice locks 10000 SPOT in elastic pool for minimum of 1 month without any incentive for time lock. 
-----> Alice  gets 100% of the pool dividends when she locks because she is the only person in the pool
-----> BOB comes and add 10000 SPOT to the pool same time as ALICE
-----> ALICE pool percentage is reduced to 50% and dividend reduced to 50% of total dividend
-----> End of first week That weeks total SPOT deposit (20000 SPOT ) is calculated and Half of the total deposit that week  (10000 SPOT ) is converted to AMPL  - Lets assume SPOT is trading at 5500 AMPL for 5000 SPOT - So Total 11000 AMPL bought for 10000 SPOT 

## -----> ----->  Case 1  Positive Rebase 
---> End of second week SPOT total continues at 10000 -- > AMPL 11000 Rebasing to 15000 AMPL --->  In SPOT Value 12000 AMPL if it equals 12000 SPOT --->The profit of the pool in terms of SPOT is now at 2000 SPOT - So  2000 AMPL profit is converted to 2000 SPOT --> 1000 SPOT remains in the Pool as accumulated profit and 1000 SPOT is emitted as dividend to the holders 500 SPOT goes to ALICE and 500 SPOT goes to BOB --> The SPOT pool keeps on increasing based on the AMPL expansion --> AMPL positive rebases are systematically captured as profit without fail so even if AMPL goes to negative rebase later the profits are already captured as SPOT. 
-----> -----> ---> Enters JOHN ---->  JOHN comes and invest 10000 AMPL But he is a late comer coming during positive rebase ----> ---->  If JOHN came before the rebase he would have gotten 33% of the POOL but as he is late he will have to bear the loading premium. Pool Value is now at 105% as the total remaining value after the dividend is equal to 10000 SPOT (ALICE + BOB) + 1000 SPOT accumulated SPOT profit + Value of 10000 AMPL is 10000 SPOT -- > So a total pool value of 21000 SPOT -- >  So John is adding 10000 SPOT to 21000 SPOT thereby having a claim to 32.2% of the pool only. And as the pool is trading in premium JOHN will get a deduction of 5% Loading premium on the 32.2% that means he will get only 30.70% That means BOB and ALICE pool percentage will be (100- 30.70)/2 = 34.65% each 

## -----> ----->  Case 2  Negative pool value ---> 
---> End of second week SPOT total continues at 10000 -- > AMPL 11000 Rebasing to 9000 AMPL --->  In SPOT Value 9000 AMPL if it equals 9000 SPOT --->The loss of the pool in terms of SPOT is now at 1000 SPOT - So  the pool continues without emitting any dividend. Pool is also locked for any redemption if the Pool is negative so that there is no run on the pool. 
-----> -----> ---> Enters JOHN ---->  JOHN comes and invest 10000 AMPL But he is a late comer coming during negative rebase ----> ---->  If JOHN came before the rebase he would have gotten 33% of the POOL but as he is late he is now lucky to get a larger slice of the pool and also gain some incentive in dividend percentage. Pool Value is now at 95% as the total remaining value of pool is equal to 10000 SPOT (ALICE + BOB) Value of 10000 AMPL is now 9000 SPOT -- > So a total pool value of 19000 SPOT -- >  So John is adding 10000 SPOT to 19000 SPOT thereby having a claim to 34.48% ( 10000/29000 *100 ) of the pool only. And as the pool is trading in loss JOHN will get an incentive of 5% Loading incentive on the 34.48% that means he will get a higher dividend claim of  38.10%  ( 34.48 +10% of 34.48 ) That means BOB and ALICE pool percentage will be (100- 38.10)/2 = 30.95% each. Unlucky for ALICE and BOB but they get JOHN as a supporter to average the pool without themselves investing any further.

And anyways JOHN and BOB and ALICE all will redeem exactly the same SPOT after maturity that is 10000 SPOT

## -----> ----->  Case 3 Higher time lock ---> 
Suppose in the same above described negative pool value scenario John locks 10000 SPOT for 30 months. 
So that means John deserve additional 30% incentive on dividends. Means instead of 38.10% he gets 30% additional ( 1.3 x 38.10 ) = His pool value is 49.53% This will generate a competition amongst the pool members to go for a higher time lock after each unlock. This longer time locks will increase the stability of the pool. ( Which is already stable because redemptions are not possible for negative pool values anyway )
