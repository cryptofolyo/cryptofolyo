## HW hashtag weightage

the % of time i have zapped satoshis for that hashtag amongst all other hashtags - there may be hundreds of hashtags and i have zapped for  #nostr and #coding say 2% and 3% each of my total zaps - so for each hashtag i have a hashtag weightage assigned - my account will be associated with only my top 5 hashtags 

## myhashtags - each accounts will have 5 hashtags added to their account dynamically based on my zapping posts ( In future weightage can be added for the myhashtags of authors whom i follow 

## AW author weightage 

the % of time an author is using the hashtag in his total usage of hashtags 

## AHRW author hastag reputation weightage

% of total satoshi earned by that author on that hashtag out of the total satoshis earned by all authors in the same hashtag.

## PRW post reputation weightage

% of total satoshi earned by that post compared to the total satoshi earned by all posts using the same top 5 hashtags during the month

## TPW total post weightage = HW x AW x AHRW x PRW

> The posts under this section `like minded zaps` are displayed in such a way that the post with maximum TPW is displayed first as the First 5 posts
> The next 3 posts will be the most recent posts on the same hashtags with highest HW 
> The next 3 posts will be the most recent posts  on the same hashtags with highest AW 
> The next 3 post will be the most recent posts on the same hashtags with the highest AHRW
> The next 3 post will be the most recent posts on the same hashtags with the highest AHRW

Out of the 12 recent posts some of the posts will start gaining more zaps and satoshis and thereby gain more visibility in the section 'like minded zaps'
