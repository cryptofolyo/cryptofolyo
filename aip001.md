# An idea - AMPOOL for AMPL dividends

Make a common pool of  AMPL with AMPL SPOT like in Balancer ( may be use balancer for that ) or make a custom dapp
Anyone can add equal quantities of AMPL and AMPL Spot to the  Pool and lock for a minimum of 300 days minimum value of 500 AMPL and 500 SPOT tokens

At the time of addition If you are adding 500  AMPL and 500 AMPL SPOT and the total count of the pool is already 39000 AMPL and 60000 AMPL SPOT then u get 1000 unit out of total 100000 AMPL+SPOT total that is 1% of the Pool. For each percentage of the pool there will be 1000 AMPOOL tokens issued. So u will be issued 1000 AMPOOL tokens.

If you are adding 500 AMPL and 500 AMPL SPOT on a later date and the total value of the pool by that time went up to 99000  AMPL and 100000 AMPL SPOT then u get 0.5% of the pool ( 1000 unit out of total 200000 AMPL+SPOT POOL ) and so u get 500 AMPOOL tokens. This gives early birds more AMPOOL tokens on lesser initial deposit
If you are adding 199000 AMPL or SPOT  when pool v is at total 199000 tokens with 99000 AMPL and 100000 SPOT tokens then u aquire 50% of the pool and u are issued 50000 AMPOOL tokens
If you are locking for 600 days u get additional 25% AMPOOL tokens as bonus. If u are locking fo 1000 days u get additional 50% AMPOOL tokens as bonus - thereby incentivising higher proportion of locked AMPL and SPOT. If the pool gets larger day by day it will keep removing AMPL and SPOT out of circulation thereby driving the stability of its valuations

Every month end the total pool valuation is calculated and if the AMPL value  is at least 40% higher than the value of SPOT tokens total invested into the pool  - because of appreciation of number of tokens of AMPL due to positive rebasing , Then one fourth of the increased token Quantity of AMPL is converted to AMPL SPOT to keep increasing the AMPL Spot Reserves in the Pool and One fourth of the increased  token quantity of  AMPL is emitted as dividend to the AMPOOL token holders proportionate to the total number of AMPOOL tokens they are holding from amongst the total count of AMPOOL tokens.

Exit from the pool is possible after the 300 days lock - Exit is possible only if the AMPL token count is at least 40% higher than the SPOT token count. That means a safe exit is possible from the pool without depleting the pool.  On exit the holder surrender the AMPOOL token and it is burned and proportionate to the % of AMPOOL token out of total AMPOOL token then the holder gets a share of the AMPL and SPOT out of the pool into his account.

AMPOOL tokens can be bought and sold by investors to gain dividends. So the locking doesnt really matter.
